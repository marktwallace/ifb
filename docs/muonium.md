# Muonium Cloud Characteristics (Reference Summary)

This document summarizes the physical characteristics of a muonium (Mu = μ⁺ + e⁻) cloud as observed in laboratory systems. This description is intended for comparison with theoretical or toy models in which space, time, and geometry may be emergent from underlying entanglement structures. Muon decay is *not* included here unless explicitly stated.

## 1. Composition

- **Mu⁺ (positive muon):** a spin-½, pointlike lepton with charge +e and mass ≈ 206.77 mₑ.
- **Electron:** spin-½, charge −e.
- Together, they form a **hydrogen-like bound state** under the Coulomb potential.

Because both constituents are pointlike leptons, **muonium has no internal nuclear structure**, making it a uniquely “clean” test hydrogenic atom.

## 2. Atomic Structure

| Property | Muonium | Hydrogen | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Bohr radius | ~0.532 Å | ~0.529 Å | ~+0.5% larger due to reduced mass |
| Ground state binding energy | ~13.54 eV | ~13.60 eV | ~0.4% less bound |
| Energy levels | Hydrogenic (1/n²) | Hydrogenic (1/n²) | Same level spacing to high precision |
| Spin state | Hyperfine doublet | Hyperfine doublet | Magnetic dipole effects similar |

In an emergent-graph model, **expect mostly hydrogenic single-particle state structure**, with small global rescaling.

## 3. Cloud Formation in Lab Conditions

Muonium clouds are typically formed by:
1. Producing μ⁺ in a target,
2. Slowing them to near rest,
3. Allowing electron capture in a medium or vacuum boundary.

The result is a **diffuse, transient ensemble** of neutral Mu atoms.

Typical properties:
- **Number density:** 10⁶–10⁹ Mu atoms/cm³ (very dilute)
- **Temperature:** Depends on formation environment; often ~300 K in gases, but can be cooled to cryogenic regimes.
- **Spatial distribution:** Approximately Gaussian or Maxwell–Boltzmann diffuse plume, expanding from a production surface.

In emergent-geometry models, this corresponds to an initially **localized node-cluster** that undergoes **diffusion dynamics**.

## 4. Motion and Diffusion

Muonium in a cloud behaves like a light neutral gas.

- **Mean thermal velocity (at ~300 K):**  
  \( v \sim \sqrt{\frac{3 k T}{m_{\text{Mu}}}} \approx 7 \times 10^4 \, \text{m/s} \)

- **Diffusion behavior:**  
  Free-flight between scattering events with random-walk expansion of the spatial distribution.

Expected behaviors to look for in a toy entanglement graph:
- Rapid spreading in effective coordinate space
- Emergent Gaussian or Lévy-like radial density profiles
- Weak inter-atom correlation (no clustering except boundary effects)

---

## 5. Interaction Behavior

- **Interactions between muonium atoms are negligible** because the cloud is extremely dilute.
- Collisions with the substrate (surfaces or lattice sites) dominate momentum redistribution.
- Hyperfine state evolution occurs coherently and can be observed spectroscopically.

In a discrete model:
- Expect **local adaptive alignment of phase/spin labels** along graph edges.
- **No strong multi-particle binding** should emerge at cloud densities.

---

## 6. Stability (Decay Ignored in This Model)

In physical systems:
- Lifetime is limited by μ⁺ decay (~2.2 μs).

In your toy system (decay suppressed):
- The cloud should remain dynamically stable.
- No internal decay or collapse processes are expected.
- The primary dynamical behavior is **diffusive spreading**, possibly modified by boundary or trapping conditions.

## 7. Observables to Compare in Emergent Models

| Observable | Real Muonium Cloud Behavior | Signals to Look For in Your Model |
|-----------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Spatial distribution | Expanding Gaussian-like plume | Does spatial structure emerge naturally? |
| Bound-state energy spectrum | Hydrogenic with uniform scale factor | Does your graph reproduce a 1/n² structure? |
| Local coherence | Hyperfine oscillations detectable | Do edges carry phase relationships? |
| Diffusion scaling | \( \langle r^2 \rangle \propto t \) | Does distance emerge as a power-law in time? |

If your model produces **hydrogenic level spacing + diffusive expansion + coherence propagation**, you are hitting the experimentally relevant features.
