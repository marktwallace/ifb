# WHY — From “it from bit” to “it from trit”

Binary was a starting point; the phase‑free core naturally elevates **trits**: +1, 0, −1.
- **+1 / −1** record **orientation/parity** of combinatorial histories.
- **0** means **no information / no event**.

No complex amplitudes or built‑in phases are stored. Any “phase”‑like effects must emerge from path combinatorics (parity), timing (arrival‑mod‑k), or holonomy (loop tags). This keeps the model **finite, discrete, and falsifiable** while remaining GPU‑friendly and deterministic.
